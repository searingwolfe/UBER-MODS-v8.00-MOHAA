<><><> Updates & Bug Fixes <><><>

v7.91 (12-5-2023): - New global/playerboat.scr script added for drivable higgins boats. Similar to drivable vehicles: hold USE to enter/exit, lean left/right to look left/right, hold FIRE to look behind.
- Reversing added for drivable vehicles/boats.
When driving and holding FIRE to look behind, vehicles will now slowly move backwards. While looking behind, hold S instead of W to drive in-reverse faster.
- "local.player.touching_playerboat" or "$player[1].touching_playerboat" can be included in trigger setthreads to exclude teleporting players that are touching "$ocean" or similar water-surface triggers.

- Fixed samename_fix thread in cvars/adminstuff.scr for players trying to change their name to someone else's name (only the name-changing player will be warned), or using a script hack to do this rapidly.
If a player tries too many times to "make same names", that player's keys will be unbinded and their game will quit after 20 attempts.
Besides adding admins' IPs into the makearray, any admins with "isadmin == 1" privileges will never be affected by the "samename_fix" thread, thus giving admins name-priority.
- Replaced IP_addresses_init player variables with Reborn's "getip" command, ensuring that players' IP addresses are always accurately printed for "samename_fix", "votekick" cvar, and "players" cvar.

- Fixed "vehicle_tele" and "vehicles_undermap" threads in some singleplayer maps that stopped working for tanks/vehicles after they blow up and respawn.
- For all maps running "g_ubergametype bb" (Base-Builder) gametype, spotlights and spotlight_colorswitches are now removed by default, in order to free up 100+ more base-build objects.

- "playerspawns" cvar added for finished singleplayer maps only (not including Training). "playerspawns 1" into console will spawn dummy models at all Allies/Axis spawns or FFA spawns. "playerspawns 0" to remove them.

---------------

- M1L3C fully modded. 2 drivable higgins boats, and 9 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 4 extra throwing knives also added.
- 3 bangalore wallbombs in Allies spawn, and 2 sets of bangalore wallbombs in Axis spawn. No airstrikes on this map, since the road between both spawns is too skinny.
- Any players that are touching a higgins boat will not be forcibly respawned if also touching the "$ocean" trigger.

- Solid floors and walls added behind the light house to expand the Axis spawn's total area.
- The tunnel behind the light house has lasers marking the map edges, and serves as a vehicle garage for the Axis.
- The light house fence has a vehicle teleporter allowing vehicles to go through the fence. Be careful not to drive facing the cliff edge.
- Any vehicles that accidentally fall off the cliff will be destroyed.

- Elevator script reworked to operate much faster. Teles added above and below the elevator to escape if trapped in the shaft.
- Minen (entmint) bombs on the top-floor Allies spawn can be blown up with grenades.
- Looping sounds added to all transformers and the red HVAC machine in Allies spawn; transformers can also be destroyed.
- Toilets can be flushed in Allies spawn, and the dripping water spigot (bucket near it) can be turned on/off.
- Airtanks in the bottom-floor Allies spawn can be turned on/off to loop a steaming sound.
- Static opeltrucks in the bottom-floor Allies spawn can be turned on/off. While on, hold USE for 1 second to honk horn; hold USE for 1-2 seconds to turn on/off headlights.
- The lighthouse can be turned on/off with the train switch in Axis spawn.

- Player spawns added and distributed more widely across the Allies/Axis spawns.
- Invisible walls block prevent any players or projectiles from going under the map or going behind rock cliffs and shooting through them.
- Some teles allow players to stand on rock cliffs or platforms on top of large rocks, to shoot players from high above them.
- Cyber Attack and Search & Destroy bombs and bombsites added to the map. Base-Builder objects reorganized.
- Bombsites in Search & Destroy will move closer to defending team's spawn each time the gamemode changes sides (when "level.changesides" changes).
