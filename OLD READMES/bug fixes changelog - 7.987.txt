v7.987 (4-13-2025): - Assisted suicides feature added into "killstreaks/damagehandler.scr".
- If players shoot at others that are falling, or within 1.5 seconds before they begin falling, the shooter will get +1 kills/score when the falling player dies/craters.
- Players can kill others using meansofdeath = 7 (death by falling) for the "damage" function, but it's never used in the game.
- In global/localization.txt, The following pink text is changed to this: { "was pushed over the edge by" "'s suicide was assisted by" }.

- To activate assisted suicides mod: add "exec killstreaks/damagehandler.scr::assisted_suicide" into the "global/dmprecache.scr" file, or remove the line to disable the mod.

- cvars/entity_pointer.scr: New UBER cvar added. The entity pointer's laser shoots out an invisible projectile, hitting the nearest entity (waittill touch; local.hitthing = parm.other). 
- This avoids using Reborn's "getentity" function to check if the laser istouching local.ent, so this cvar can be used in normal AA-SH-BT.
- When touched, the entity's origin, angles, classname, entnum, model, targetname, target, health, scale, and any attached guns are iprinted to the player.
- Sadly, these entities must be solid for this to work, but it can still be useful (i.e. the "spawn" command will still spawn solid vehicles: "rcon spawn models/vehicles/jeep.tik").

- Ensured that all Giant Bomb & Light Bomb's radiusdamages give kills/score to the player that launched them (rarely it wouldn't work).
- UBER cvars that are loaded at the top of each map script are now found in the "cvars/cvars.scr" file, executed at the top of each map script instead. Details for each UBER cvar are also in this file.

- Drivable bmwbikes can now honk horns. Trucks make normal horn sounds. Cars make higher pitched horn sounds. Bmwbikes make the highest pitched horns sounds.
- Destroyed drivable boats will now make various water wave & water splash sounds while they are sinking.
- These sinking boat sounds are also added for the "higgins_death" thread in M3L1A.

- global/deathcam.scr mod updated to prevent dead players that are spectating their killers from respawning too quickly if they/their killer switches teams, or if their killer leaves the game.
