v7.986 (3-24-2025): - When driving boats and turning left/right, water spray emitters will appear next to the boat (or at the hull tips for uboats).
- Drivable boats that explode will now sink underwater, only if touching a "level.water_volumes". Water spray emitters also appear for 10 seconds after the boat explodes.
- The water spray emitters, along with uboats' turret laser & laser point entities, will only spawn when a player is driving the boats (reducing entity count).
- Destroyed higgins boats will now spawn a higgins door either opened or closed, depending on where the door was before the boat exploded.

- All remaining destroyed vehicles whose dead models do not have fire & smoke will now spawn fire & smoke emitters.

- Fixed global/respawn_stuck_fix.scr again to guarantee respawning any player that gets stuck inside a wall (getposition == "offground") at any time, but cannot move anywhere.
- If the map has $allied_spawn or $axis_spawn points (info_player_[team] entities), the auto-respawn script will teleport the player to a spawn's origin, instead of doing "respawn" (sometimes moves the player away from the origin).
- Players using the "noclip2" cvar will no longer be affected by global/respawn_stuck_fix.scr, fixed by adding: $player[local.i] moveposflags "standing" to the cvar script (in cvars/adminstuff.scr).

- Fixed M2L2A, M2L2B, M2L2C spamming console errors to console due to their "vehicles_undermap" threads having an array error.
