v7.95 (4-19-2024): - Various player-damaging scripts modified for giving scorepoints to player killers and preventing teammates from being killed by vehicle/tank/boat/plane weapons or explosions.

- Press JUMP to exit nebelwerfers and flak88s now, along with other drivable stuff; hold FIRE(zoom) to look around.
- Players driving uboats can now lean left/right to aim turret projectiles up/down (only while moving), instead of only shooting them in a horizontal line (a laser is visible while adjusting aim). Lean left/right while not moving to look behind.

- Claymore, Cluster Mine, Sentry Turret killstreaks will respond to enemies driving vehicles/tanks/boats, flying planes, riding as passengers, and riding as turret players, properly giving kills/scorepoints for most scenarios.
- Sentry Turrets will not shoot at players driving vehicles/tanks/boats if there are no other passengers or turret players, since drivers cannot be killed with bullets.

- Giant Bombs, Light Bombs, Nebelwerfers, Flak88s, Flyable planes' bullets/rockets/ejected planes, uboat projectiles, airstrike bombs killing players that are riding in vehicles/tanks/boats/planes will properly give kills/scorepoints to the player that launched projectiles from them.
- Tank & Flak88 projectiles will give kills/scorepoints to the player that launched them for most other cases too.
- Bangalore wall bombs & Radiobomb Walkies also give kills/scorepoints to the player that triggered them.

- Ensured that players cannot attempt to get into vehicles whose passenger seats are all occupied.
- Passengers in vehicles/boats that are auto-exited by drivers getting out of them will also be checked if they're stuck in a wall. If so, the script respawns the passengers.
- Improved player reset threads when exiting vehicles/tanks/boats to better avoid players getting stuck in them when on sharply-angled sloped terrain.

- Vehicle/tank "_trig" triggers are now glued to their vehicles/tanks, so vehicles/tanks and their triggers are at the exact same origin initially.
- Tank setsizes readjusted (mainly kingtank.tik). Tank cannons are now solid.

- Revamped Tank & Flak88 shooting by replacing their original projectiles (causing radiusdamage from $world after exploding) with scripted ones (modifying tank cannon .tiks) that give kills/scorepoints to the driver when needed.
- Tank & Flak88 projectiles will no longer deal radiusdamage and kill teammates if exploding too close to at least 1 teammate, even if they're driving or riding in something.

- Flyable planes that players eject from (on fire and crashing) will no longer deal radiusdamage and kill teammates if exploding too close to at least 1 teammate, even if they're driving or riding in something.
- Players who switch teams during first-flight instructions will no longer be teleported back to the plane trigger for flying a plane (flight is cancelled).

- Prevented dropped bombs in bomberplane.scr and bomberplane_nospline.scr from killing the airstrike planes.
- Flyable planes will no longer blow up if they touch a projectile owned by a teammate (not including in FFA), and kills/scorepoints will be given to the projectile's owner that touches/blows up any planes.

- cvars/adminstuff.scr script now uses admins' IPs in a level array variable (top of script) to prevent admins from getting auto-kicked for same-name fix & stufftext-check threads (or make sure $player[admin clientnum + 1] isadmin == 1).

---------------

- The new script, global/ambience_mp.scr, recreates ambience sound changes between different environments in singleplayer maps, for multiplayer purposes.
- Originally, global/ambient.scr would run only the "normal" soundtrack (from music/[map name].mus in Pak0.pk3), or switch between soundtracks if $player walked through any $interior or $exterior triggers.
- Players that are inside of a volume will run stufftext "tmstop; tmloop [music filepath]" only if the music filepath is different from their current playing music.
- Players will only change music once per 40 frames, preventing spamming when standing at ambience volume borders.
- The script can also make players run stufftext "s_musicvolume 1" if local.forcemaxvolume = 1 in the main script, to ensure that all players hear the ambience.
- Music volume must be greater than 0% to hear these ambient sounds.

- If debug iprint = 1 (local.debug = 1), players will iprint music filepath each time a new ambient sound plays, and music will change faster (once per frame).
- If a player walks into an area where 2+ volumes are still overlapping (should never happen, but runs if the script failed to see the overlap), the player's origin is printed and the script ends.
- Ambience volumes are like triggers, but triggers aren't actually spawned. They should fill the whole interior of a building, or whatever 3D region that players will hear interior ambience within it (or other special ambiences).
- Circular volumes (light houses), curved or diagonal walls (not along X-Y axis) will require several small rectangular volumes stacked like pancakes to fill in these interior areas.

- Main script parameters: outside/exterior ambient music filepath, force max volume (0 = no, 1 = yes), debug iprint (0 = no, 1 = iprint music, change music faster).

- First, create a "level.spawnambs = makeArray" and add various ambience volumes, starting with origin and both -/+ setsizes, then the music to be played inside it.
- Then, run "exec global/ambience_mp.scr local.music" where "local.music" = ambience music filepath for outdoors music to be played (the default ambience to play when players are outside all other volumes).
- If any 2 volumes are overlapping and/or touching in all 3 axes (x,y,z), then the 2nd volume is removed and replaced with 0s in the makeArray.
- Errors print suggestions for fixing a volume's setsizes or origin if any volume is deleted.
- If level.spawnamb does not exist or doesn't have any volumes, the map's ambience will default to "local.music".

- Parameters: origin, setsize 1, setsize 2, indoors ambient music filepath.
- Example:
	ambience: // make sure the spawnamb volumes are not touching or overlapping!!!

		level.spawnamb = makeArray // map M2L1.
			( -1903 -3775 380 ) ( 0 0 0 ) ( 351 351 379 ) sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SnowInt.mp3		// amb[1]
			( -73 2415 360 ) ( 0 -911 0 ) ( 1528 0 423 ) sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SnowInt.mp3		// amb[2]
			( 1455 3343 380 ) ( -1487 -927 0 ) ( 0 0 226 ) sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SnowInt.mp3		// amb[3]
			( 2816 7879 -307 ) ( 0 -1108 0 ) ( 1455 0 882 ) sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SubFacility.mp3		// amb[4]
		endArray

		exec global/ambience_mp.scr sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SnowExt.mp3
		//exec global/ambience_mp.scr sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M2_SnowExt.mp3 1 1 // outdoors music filepath, force max music volume, debug iprint.
	end

---------------

- M2L3 fully modded. 4 flyable planes, 1 flak88, 1 nebelwerfer, 3 tanks, 4 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 5 extra throwing knives also added.
- 1 set of bangalore wallbombs (two-way switch) between the truck garage and Axis spawn outdoors. Airstrikes are not included in this level.

- The train's splinepath is extended along the curved railroad, and extended from the train tunnel. The tunnel itself is extended all the way to the map's edge.
- Press USE(e) near the train and the fence to ride in the train. The train moves automatically. Hold USE(e) for 1 second to exit the train (only when outside of the "player_clip" brushes).
- Any players that exit the train while it's moving will appear on top of the train. Press USE(e) while looking down to re-enter the train. Walking too close to the edge of a moving train will kill the player.
- When the train arrives and fully stops, all players inside the train-front and the train cab will automatically exit the train and teleported to the ground.
- Players/vehicles/tanks that touch the moving train will be killed/destroyed.

- Up to 2 players (teammates only, does not work in FFA) can ride in the front of the train (the bp44train.tik model), and they must hop in before the train is moving too fast.
- The 2 train-front riders can shoot from the train's windows, and aim by holding FIRE(zoom). These players can be shot/killed by other players shooting at the train's windows too.

- Up to 20 players (5 rows, 4 columns) can ride in the train cab, regardless of teammates. The riders can shoot and aim by holding FIRE(zoom), or exit the train cab by holding USE(e).
- When train starts moving (only when a player gets into the train-front, the bp44train), all players inside the train cab will be locked into 1 of 20 available seats.
- If all seats are filled, the extra players are teleported back outside of the cab on the ground.

- If players on opposite teams are riding in the train cab together, anywhere they shoot will cause damage to their riding enemies since the damage-respoding trigger covers the whole cab's interior.
- The train cab rider in the 1st seat (middle row, closest to door) can toggle opening/closing the solid traincab door by Leaning Left/Right
- If the train cab door is closed, players inside the cab cannot be shot/killed or shoot/kill others.

- 2 vehicle teles for vehicles to enter/exit the truck garage. Various extra roads outlined by lasers spawned in extra map areas.
- Other lasers on the rooftops help prevent players from falling off edges.

- Thick green lasers on the ground outline "player_clip" brushes from the map's .bsp (brushes cannot be removed), since players cannot walk through them.
- Vehicles/tanks can drive through them, but players that exit them while inside these brushes will get trapped (respawned after 3 seconds).
- Building rooftops and ledges are solified with "script_origin"s and accessible via teles from the ground (glitching can occur when standing still. To reduce entity count, smaller "script_model"s were not used).

- Numerous sound entities added throughout the Allies spawn and truck garage: 3 generators, 16 transformers, 8 air vents.
