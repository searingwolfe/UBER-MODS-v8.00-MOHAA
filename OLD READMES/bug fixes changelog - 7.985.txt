v7.985 (3-22-2025): - Reworked Base-Builder script again (alienx/basebuilder.scr) to fix more lift & tele bugs, added more building features, and added more CVARs:
 
- New basebuilder cvars added for admins (alienx/alienxcvars.scr):
- alx_removeall [27 or Searingwolfe] (remove everything placed by $player[27] or by Searingwolfe). Using players' names only works in MOHAA Reborn 1.12.
- alx_removeobjects [27 or Searingwolfe] (remove all static objects placed by $player[27] or by Searingwolfe).
- alx_removeturrets [27 or Searingwolfe] (remove all TurretGun objects placed by $player[27] or by Searingwolfe).
- alx_removelifts [27 or Searingwolfe] (remove all lifts placed by $player[27] or by Searingwolfe).
- alx_removeteles [27 or Searingwolfe] (remove all teles placed by $player[27] or by Searingwolfe).

- Hold USE(e) + Lean left/right to activate a yellow "Builder Remover Laser".
- Hold USE(e) + hold FIRE at an object, lift, or tele that you placed to pick it up again (laser will turn red while picking it up).
- Players can only pick up their own objects, unless logged in as admin (isadmin = 1).
 
- While holding an object or lift: hold FIRE, then hold USE(e) to remove it.
- While holding a tele: hold USE(e), then hold FIRE to remove it.

- When placing lifts and after first setting the start-position, the builder laser will turn red if the lift is below its start-position + 25 units (cannot be placed).
- While setting the destination-position, the lift's angle will now match the player's current angle.
- Hold USE(e) to hold the lift's angle in its current position, and hold the build-laser's current length.

- Players can no longer place objects on top of any basebuilder triggers.
- Fixed bugs that caused MG42 guns to be angled vertically when switching between MG42 and other objects.
- While in Trimming Mode (holding FIRE(zoom) in Reborn 1.12 only; blue builder laser), walking while moving forward/backward will now maintain the builder laser's length for new objects.
- Other basebuilder cvars, such as alx_timeboost & alx_objectlimitboost, will now print corresponding changes to the server's console window.

---------------

- The CVAR hack detection script in cvars/adminstuff.scr will no longer kick all other players if one player has 1+ CVAR hacks in their .userinfo string.
- The hacker will also be kicked 3 seconds after detection, to avoid "ihuddraw NULL player" errors printing to console.

- global/bomberplane_nospline.scr more accurately randomizes starting and ending points for the airstrike planes' path. Planes' angles also sway slightly left/right & up/down while moving.
- In a map's "airstrikes_alternate" thread, level.bomberplane_map_setsize1 and 2 values are alternated, allowing airstrikes to bomb different regions of the map (particularly if those regions have different map heights).
- Added 2 more level variables to control airstrikes, adding to 5 total:
- level.bomberplane_health = 200; these are defaults set inside global/bomberplane_nospline.scr
- level.bomberplane_bombspeed = 0.25; speed multiplier; higher = bombs drop horizontally further away from plane's splinepath
- level.bomberplane_bombgravity = 2; higher = bombs drop faster vertically & closer to plane's splinepath
- level.bomberplane_bombspawntime = 0.2; time between spawning bombs; lower = bombs spawn less often.
- level.bomberplane_speed = 2350; lower = planes move slower.

- All UBER triggers' setsizes reduced to avoid players triggering them up through some walls.
- All UBER triggers that can be picked up/dropped by players will droptofloor when the player dies, without going through entities.
- Giant Bombs & Light Bombs will now speed up to 6500 velocity if they somehow don't reach their ground-target destination before their level.bomb_time variable expires.

- global/vehicle_tele.scr now has 2 additional parameters (height_1 & height_2) only if "align" parameter = 0 or 1, for teleporting vehicles/tanks upwards in one direction, and/or downwards in the other direction.

- Player deathcams (killcams) from global/deathcam.scr will now stay at their killer's dead body's origin if the killer died while player deathcams were following him.
- Dead players will be force-respawned if their deathcam somehow waited longer than 5 seconds, instead of 8 seconds.
- The "g_deathcam" cvar will now maintain its value (either 1 or 0) between maps that running & not running UBER gametypes (cyb, snd, ft).
- The console will print "NOTE: The cvar for deathcams mod is: g_deathcam" if admins attempt to use the incorrect g_deathcams cvar.

- The "findent" cvar will now print the entity's scale if it doesn't equal 1.
- Mini-Flak88 flamethrowers' fire projectiles no longer have gravity (fly in straight lines).
- Combined all TDM and FFA spawns in singleplayer maps into one thread.
- Changed guided missile damageflags to deal rocket damage if directly impact a player (for printing "took [player]'s rocket in the kisser" kill messages), or otherwise deal regular explosion damage.
- Changed maps/gen_mapscripts/bonfire.scr damageflags to deal lava/fire damage.
- Added water landing and metal landing sounds for Cluster Mine killstreaks.

- "self thread waittill_touch local" placed before numerous "waittill touch" script lines, particularly the airstrike scripts.
- Entities can sometimes fall outside the map. If they do, they will never touch anything. If they're forcibly removed after a time duration, "waittill touch" and its accompanying thread will still never finish.
- In the "waittill_touch" threads, "if(vector_length(self.origin) > 12000)" ensures that entities are removed if they go too far outside the map.
- Also in the "waittill_touch" threads, "local.thread remove" fully ends the "local" threads that contain "waittill_touch".
- Some scripts' projectiles/bombs that are waiting to touch something (or velocity == ( 0 0 0 )) will stop moving and explode/get removed if they touch any "level.water_volumes".
- Ensured that flying planes, plane bomb drops, and guided missiles properly make water explosions when touching any "level.water_volumes".

- Crashing flyable planes' angles will point more vertically downward if players eject while facing downward.
- Crashing flyable planes's angles now exactly match their current velocity's trajectory (plane.angles = vector_toangles(plane.velocity)).
- If rockets from flyable planes directly impact a player, the rockets will deal "rocket" damage instead of generic "explosion" damage (for printing "took [player]'s rocket in the kisser" kill messages).
- Players that crash their own planes will now "blow themselves up" instead of "blowing up", causing the game to subtract 1 kill from their score.

- global/cyberattack_searchdestroy.scr: added more HUD at the bottom left of the screen for each team's total player count and their living players count.
- Fixed total player count not decreasing when a player leaves during a round.

---------------

- Drivable vehicles/boats/flak88s/nebelwerfers now have 1 or 2 additional glued triggers for further ensuring that kills/scorepoints are given to players when killing drivers (these triggers only exist when a player is driving).
- For flak88s & nebelwerfers, these triggers also prevent teammates from sniping and destroying them (teammates would not die from the explosion), however this feature only works in Reborn 1.12.
- For vehicles & boats, these triggers now allow players to shoot & kill drivers or passengers by aiming at their heads (even though they are currently notsolid).
- However for vehicles on steep sloped terrain, shooting at the driver's head may still not work since the driver's model is glued to their seat, not the driver's actual hitbox.

- Improved vehicle/boat death fire & smoke emitter locations based on dead vehicle/boat's angles.
- Fixed players switching teams in drivable vehicles/boats not fully respawning (they would respawn back above the vehicle/boat).
- Fixed vehicles/tanks that were instantly resetting if they get flooded first by a Light Bomb, then blown up before their reset-time duration finishes.
- Passengers' viewangles will now match their vehicle/boat's viewangles, similar to the driver's viewangles.
- Drivable sdkfz halftracks now have sdkfz_shield notsolid models on top of them. Jeep 30 Cal turrets on sdkfz halftracks also moved slightly down to be directly on the roof.
- Added static/corona_util.tik to mark the endpoint of the drivable uboat's aiming laser (lean left/right while moving to adjust turret's aim).

- Anytime a vehicle/boat/tank respawns, it will now tele players onto the top of them, instead of players getting stuck inside them.
- Dogs can now bite and kill drivers or passengers riding in vehicles/boats.

- Fixed driver cameras for jeep, jeep_bench, opeltruck, opeltruckgreen, & opeltruckgreen_canopy vehicles, since for some reason .tik file "seatoffset" does not work for these models (new "driver_seat" entity for these models, for drivers to be glued onto).
- All drivers and passengers are now glued to a vehicle/boat's spawned attachmodel, keeping their origins exactly in place, and matching their body's angles (as opposed to their viewangles) exactly with the vehicle/boat's angles (attachmodel despawns when driver/passenger exits the vehicle/boat).
- Increased max passenger seats for the following vehicles from 5 seats to 7 seats: opeltruck, opeltruckgreen, opeltruckgreen_canopy, m3, gmctruck.

- Drivers in opeltrucks or gmctrucks can now see behind them when holding FIRE for rear-view mirror (player briefly unglues from driver_seat attachmodel and glues onto rear_view attachmodel).
- Drivers in higgins boats can now open/close their higginsdoor model by leaning right/left respectively. When open, the solid door acts as a ramp for players to more easily get into the boat. Players touching the open doors will also not be auto-respawned if touching any "ocean" or similar triggers.

- For AA-SH-BT (non-Reborn): drivers in vehicles/boats now have horn, headlights, uboat aiming laser, and higgins door assigned to the A - D keys (left-right keys).

---------------

- Potentially fixed rare Runtime errors that freeze/crash the server when switching maps (errors from "intermisison" threads would be the last lines printed to qconsole.log):
- Removed "intermission" threads from global/victory_podium.scr & cvars/adminstuff.scr, and combined them into one isolated script: global/intermission_serverautoreopen.scr, to avoid loading both at the same time.
- MOHAA_server_auto-reopen_Windows.bat (only available in xNULL website's download for UBER MODS) now checks for any errors coming from global/intermission_serverautoreopen.scr, indicating Runtime errors.

---------------

- M5L1A fully modded. 4 vehicles, 1 flak88, 2 nebelwerfers, 8 extra throwing knives added to the map.
- Invisible higginsxtrahull.tik script_models added below the map's yellow dirt road to solidify it for vehicles to drive over, otherwise they would fall through.

- Airstrikes occur at random times across any X-Y-axis direction on one half of the map (which half is randomized too), being split between the central origin ( -576 0 0 ) instead of ( 0 0 0 ).
- 6 bangalore wall-bombs at the entrances of all buildings with visible interior and windows.
- 2 vehicle teles: one at Allies spawn to cross the two metal gates, and one at the wooden gates to cross from the lower yellow dirt road to the upper stone road.

- The wooden gates between the Allies and Axis spawns can be opened/closed by pressing USE(e) near the center of them.

- The building above the wooden gates can be blown up with rockets or other large explosives (not including grenades), spawning rubble and smoke emitters around the wooden gates street path.
- These smoke emitters slowly decrease in scale over 180 seconds, until they disappear completely.

- Numerous red and green lasers outline invisible floors, walls, roofs, and staircases.
- Map areas reclaimed: Allies spawn corner building, and several floors within the tall Axis spawn buildings. Tall tower window and Allies building attic window are accessible via red teles.
- 3 bonfire triggers will burn players for a few seconds if they get too close to the fires. Smoke emitters also added for each fire.
- 6 cabinet switches can open/close cabinets.
