v7.987 (5-6-2025): - UBER MODS now allows for multiple "sv_maplist" cvars in server.cfg, bypassing the 256 character limit for one "sv_maplist" (the cvar also cannot be 0 characters or "").
- Add "exec global/sv_maplists.scr" to global/dmprecache.scr.

- "global/sv_maplists.scr" will search up to 999 maplists to see if the current map is also the last map in the list (lowest list iteration).
- If it's the last map in "sv_maplist4" for example, "sv_maplist5" will be copied to "sv_maplist", and the next map will be the first map in "sv_maplist5".
- Manually switching maps to a map from a different maplist than "sv_maplist" will auto-copy the new maplist to "sv_maplist".

- Do not use "sv_maplist0"; it is keeping memory of the original "sv_maplist".
- Do not have 2+ lists ending with the same map name, otherwise the script will keep copying the list after the first one with said map name.
- Do not have the same map name in 2 different lists (only in the same list).

- Examples in server.cfg (the 2nd list can also start at "sv_maplist1"):

	seta sv_maplist "dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm2 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm4 dm/mohdm5 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm7"
	seta sv_maplist2 "obj/obj_team1 obj/obj_team2 obj/obj_team3 obj/obj_team4"
	seta sv_maplist3 "training m1l1 m1l2a m1l2b m1l3a m1l3b m1l3c m2l1 m2l2a m2l2b m2l2c m2l3 m3l1a m3l1b m3l2 m3l3 m4l0 m4l1 m4l2 m4l3"
	seta sv_maplist4 "m5l1a m5l1b m5l2a m5l2b m5l3 m6l1a m6l1b m6l1c m6l2a m6l2b m6l3a m6l3b m6l3c m6l3d m6l3e void"

- If using the map example below, do not add more than 1 maplist, since this script may not follow the correct sequence:
- Maplist example: dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm3 dm/mohdm6

	seta sv_maplist "dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm6"	 // this will work as intended;
	seta sv_maplist2 "dm/mohdm1 dm/mohdm6 dm/mohdm3" // once loading dm/mohdm6 in the 2nd list, the script will think you are at the end of the 1st list.

---------------

- Moved some scripts into an "ubermods" folder to simplify some server settings, and to fix spamming errors caused by "sv_maplist" cvar (from server.cfg).
- If "sv_maplist" = "", or "sv_maplist" = [any string > 256 characters], the console will spam "Update of script position - This is not an error."

- New UBER Cvar added: "findset [set number]" or "findset all". This cvar will find any/all scripted exploders on the map, from global/exploder.scr.
- Typing "findset 15" will print to console any exploder-related entities' entnums & targetnames that have the #set 15 (.set = 15).
- Typing "findset all" will print to console all the #set entities it can find, and prints how many entities that each #set has.

- The "find [targetname]" cvar will now print as much entity info as the "findent [entnum]" cvar.
- These cvars will also print origin & angles in simplified decimals (for example: 0.0000 now prints 0, 1.2300 now prints 1.23, 10.0100 now prints 10.01).
- Added "simplify_decimal" thread to global/math.scr, outputting the simplified decimal as a string. For example: local.string = waitthread global/math.scr::simplify_decimal 10.0100.

- Server-side "cheats" can now be enabled/disabled without restarting the map, simply by typing "cheats 1" or "thereisnomonkey 1" into the console, either one will auto-set the other to "1" (set to "0" to disable cheats).

- Exploder threads in M5L2A and M5L1B revamped (all other maps coming soon) to reduce entity count.
- Instead of using mini Tiger Tanks as non-grenade explosion triggers, 2 triggers are placed around each exploder (one for explosions, another for projectiles).
- If a $world explosion occurs near the triggers, or a Player-weapon explosion occurs after a rocket/tank projectile is detected, the exploder blows up.
- One exploder triggered by Players' projectiles will not trigger other nearby exploders. Only a $world explosion's with a large enough radius can trigger 2+ exploders simultaneously.
- Once exploded, the exploder will spawn 2 nearby radiusdamages, a higgins explosion, a bombwall debris emitter, and 2 sherman smoke emitters that linger for a few seconds.

- Players can no longer enter vehicles/tanks/boats/flak88s/nebelwerfers if they are leaning left/right, and also cannot enter flak88s/nebelwerfers if they are crouching.
- This allows players to grab triggers, throwing knives, etc that are next to these drivable entities.
- Players that are currently entering vehicles/tanks/boats (gun is holstering) can also cancel entering by leaning left/right.
- Added "self.driver exit" to drivable entity scripts to ensure that players have fully exited when getting out/dying/switching teams/etc (may be unnecessary, but doesn't negatively affect scripts).

- global/victory_podium.scr now shows "1st place", "2nd place", "3rd place" player name text in gold, silver, bronze respectively when each map ends.
- Fixed potential spamming NULL "local.entity.driver" errors in killstreaks/damagehandler.scr.

---------------

- The console will now print on one line how many entities there are for each $exploder, $explodersmashed, $exploderchunk, $exploderfire, $explodertrigger, instead of printing numerous lines.
- Improved global/exploder.scr script by adding threads to fully remove exploders or killing exploders, and reducing as many entities as possible afterwards.

- "thread global/exploder.scr::remove #" (# being the #set value of the exploder) can be added to remove the #set exploder's entities that are no longer needed,
- but keeps the remaining "explodersmashed" entities, unless "exploder.scr::remove # 1" is run instead; "exploder" and "exploderfire" entities are not removed until all other exploders have exploded.
Add the line above after running "exec global/exploder.scr::explode #".

- "thread global/exploder.scr::kill_exploders" can be added to destroy all exploders and remove their chunks' .target entities.
- This keeps the remaining "explodersmashed" entities, unless "exploder.scr::kill_exploders 1" is run instead.

- "thread global/exploder.scr::remove_exploders" can be added to remove all exploder-related entities and keep their original forms.
- This keeps the original "exploder" entities, unless "exploder.scr::remove_exploders 1" is run instead.

---------------

- M5L2A fully modded.

- Airstrikes occur at random times across any X-Y-axis direction on the map.
- One mortar dirt explosion will occur randomly on the map after a random short amount of time.

- Since this map has 27 exploders (and several more exploder-related entities), some mods are enabled/disabled only if the cvar "g_ubermods 1" or "g_ubermods 2" is set.
- For "g_ubermods 2":
	- 4 vehicles, 2 tanks, 4 flyable plane triggers, 2 flak88, 2 nebelwerfers added to the map.
	- 27 structures can be blown up with rockets/tanks or other large explosives (not including grenades). These exploders are removed if "g_ubergametype bb" is set (base-builder).
	- Only a few red teleporters are added.
	- 3 telephone poles can be run over and flattened by tanks.

- For "g_ubermods 1":
	- 8 extra throwing knives ("g_ubermods 1" only) added.
	- All 27 exploders are disabled, and related entities are removed except for the buildings' original forms.
	- All red teleporters, crates, and banquet tables are added.
	- UBER map_triggers that are usually exclusive to "g_ubermods 2" are also available in this map.
	- Spotlights, LED Trap triggers, and 11 bangalore wallbombs are added (one is a detonator within Axis spawn buildings, instead of an alarmswitch).
	- 10 bangalore wallbombs added to the entrances of various buildings.
