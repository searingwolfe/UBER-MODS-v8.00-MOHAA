v7.993 (10-15-2025): - Passengers in drivable vehicles/boats will now rotate their bodies when holding FIRE(zoom) and looking around.
- Prevented passengers from damaging themselves if shooting at their vehicle/boat for all instances.
- Fixed SDKFZ mg42 turrets occasionally not shooting from the turret player's crosshairs.
- Removed SDKFZ mg42 turret glue entities for moving the turrets down a few units since they were not resetting properly, breaking the turrets (may re-add later if fixed).
- Fixed tank/vehicle turret players' cameras from getting messed up when killing a vehicle driver ("cuecamera" was causing problems, so it was removed from drivable vehicle/boat/tank scripts).
- Tank drivers that blow up players sitting in passenger & turret seats will now receive scorepoints for blowing them up.
- Players that get into vehicle/tank turrets (jeep_30cal.tik) will now be instantly rotated to the angles they were facing before getting in, by briefly rotating the entire vehicle's angles (may not work if vehicle/tank is near a wall).
- Players getting into vehicles/tanks can now also hold FIRE to use the 30_cal turret, instead of only pressing & releasing FIRE before being placed into the driver seat (easier for players to use turret seats).
- Prevented camera problems for tank drivers, VehicleTurretGun users, & TurretGun users when other tank drivers exit tanks (due to "cueplayer" affecting all players), by respawning the driver & moving him back to the tank when exiting it.
- Fixed players' invisible weapon & arm that occurs when exiting tanks, by adding "EXIT_TANK" & "RAISE_WEAPON_T" states to "global/[name]_torso.st" file, which puts weapon away, then raises it again after waiting until torso anims are done.

- Changed Incendiary Snowball Gun (Hi-Standard Silenced Pistol, map_triggers/snowball_ammo.scr) damaging emitter from "snowdrift" to "aircraft_explosion" (formerly named "Toxic Snowball Gun").
- For Reborn / Nightfall only: the Incendiary Snowball Gun will immolate nearby enemy players by gluing an "explosion_conflagration" emitter onto them for a few seconds.
- For Reborn / Nightfall only: if a player kills themselves with this weapon, the death message will print "was reduced to a pile of smoldering ashes" instead of "turned into pink mist".

- Players that throw knives will now do an arm-throwing animation when unarmed as well (previously only worked if holding a weapon).
- Players that throw Giant Bombs or Light Bombs will now do an arm-throwing animation.
- Added a readme in "global/throwingknife.scr", since this script now uses a new "THROW_OBJECT" state in "_torso.st" global file (also added a readme in "global/give_players_knives.scr").
- Throwing knives will now fall to the ground if hitting a player/entity and after that entity moves or disappears.

- For setting a map's "level.interior_volumes" array (in the "weather" folder) for global/ambience_mp.scr,
- The first number should not = 1 or greater, otherwise the script will remove it when exploder #set 1 gets removed.
- Since the first number can be a decimal to control the "rain sounds" volume for this volume, make this "0.99999" to maintain a max volume of "1".
- Setting the second number = 1 forces any weather to play "outside" sounds for this volume instead of "interior" sounds, allowing for multiple different "outside" ambiences. 
- Example:	( -3648 -3232 0 ) ( -10000 -10000 -10000 ) ( 0 1132 10000 ) sound/amb_stereo/Amb_M6_ParkAreaExt.mp3 0.99999 1

- "global/rocketfix.scr" (script for rotating by 180 degrees all rocket projectiles' angles) will now end before map intermission begins (when map time = 0), to prevent potential server crashes.
- Players with Radiobomb Walkies (maps/gen_mapscripts/radiobomb_walkietrig.scr) can now, by default, use walkies to blow up radiobombs without first moving the radiobombs from their initial origins.
- Updated "map_triggers/joint_trigger.scr" with more smoke emitters. Players holding USE(e) to smoke the joint will emit smoke from their mouths.

- The "find", "findent", "proximity_pointer", and "entity_pointer" cvars will also print ".setsize1" and ".setsize2" for the selected entity if they exist.
- Increased rocket launcher damage from 250 to 500 per rocket, allowing only 2+ rockets to blow up a drivable tank instead of 4+ rockets.
- Increased the size of flyable planes' rocket projectiles & bomb drops.
- Players that directly hit flyable planes with a tank shell or other projectiles will now receive scorepoints.

- Players that blow themselves up with rocket launchers will print "rocketed himself" death message, instead of the normal "blew himself up" death message (Reborn / Nightfall only).
- Server will now print to console "Intermission... Changing maps shortly." when map time has ended.

---------------

- New script created: "global/respawn_fix.scr".

- This script moves respawned players to a new "$allied_spawn" or "$axis_spawn" point (if they exist) that is furthest away from all enemies & not next to teammates.
- Sometimes, players can spawn camp enemies even if there's other further-away spawn points outside of the camp zone, since the game may prefer spawn points in map corners/edges or outside the original map's bounds.
- If 2+ teammates are stuck inside each other, the script will auto-respawn them.

- NOTE: Do not use this script if 2+ spawn points exist that don't have any targetnames in the map's original .BSP (i.e. map dm/mohdm1, dm/mohdm2 ... obj/obj_team1, obj/obj_team2...),
- since the players will only be moved to spawn points with "$[team]_spawn" targetnames ("$deathmath_spawn" for FFA gametypes).

- Add "exec global/respawn_fix.scr" into "global/dmprecache.scr", or add it after "level waittill spawn" to use this script.
- For respawning to team-spawnpoints besides "allied_spawn", "axis_spawn", "deathmatch_spawn": add the example below instead with different names (each teams' spawnpoints all must have the same name):
- Parameters: allies spawnpoint targetname, axis spawnpoint targetname, free-for-all spawnpoint targetname
- Example: exec global/respawn_fix.scr "new_allies_spawn" "new_axis_spawn" "new_ffa_spawn"

---------------

- New script created: "global/player_taunts.scr".

- This script allows players to press the USE(e) key 5 times within 1 second to perform a taunt for 3-6 seconds.

- The player will do a "show_papers" taunt if holding a weapon, or do a "selectionidle" taunt if not holding any weapons.
- Players can shoot or switch weapons to cancel the taunt.
- Players must not be holding FIRE when pressing USE(e) key 4 times.
- Players can only taunt once every 3 seconds.

- Add "exec global/player_taunts.scr" into "global/dmprecache.scr", or add it after "level waittill spawn" to use this script.

---------------

- New script created: "global/server_crashed.scr".

- This script writes the server's current map to "cvars/mapname.txt".
- When the server crashes, the map will be changed to the "next map" after the map that was running when the server last crashed (full list in "nextmap" thread).
- For example, if the server crashed on dm/mohdm6, the server will auto-reopen and change to dm/mohdm7 (instead of staying on the map initially ran by server.cfg).

- This script can run with other server auto-reopen scripts. Whenever the server closes & then reopens, the server will auto-change maps to the "next map".
- This script only works in Reborn / Nightfall.

- Add [seta server_crashed "1"] in server.cfg.
- Add "exec global/server_crashed.scr" in global/dmprecache.scr for this script to work.

---------------

- M6L2A fully modded.

- Added "hail" weather ("snow" and "blizzard" don't work very well, since the map is too tall; "func_rain" entities must be spawned with custom setsizes lower than the map's height for these weather types).

- 5 jetpacks added for players to fly onto any rooftop, since adding too many teles will max out the map's 1024 max entities.
- 3 ladders added for the 2 wooden towers & in the Axis spawn for climbing up/down the snowy park building window near the edge of the map.
- 5 hanging road signs ($swinger1 to 5) will swing back and forth with randomizing speeds. If swinging fast enough, the sign will play a "gate_iron_open" sound.
- 2 wooden spotlight towers will occasionally play wood creaking sounds.

- For "g_ubermods 2":
	- 6 vehicles, 4 flyable planes, 1 radiobomb walkie, 8 extra throwing knives added to the map (removed if "g_ubergametype bb", base-builder, is set).
	- 1 vehicle tele added for passing through the central metal fence.
	- 6 radios inside the bunkers can turn on/off and cycle through playing 3 static sounds or music while turned on.
	- 2 metal stoves inside the bunkers can turn on/off to play fireplace sounds with orange illumination.
	- 1 fireplace has a valve switch next to it that can turn on/off black smoke emitting from the fire.
	- 1 toilet can be flushed & 2 sink/tub faucets can turn on/off to play water drip sounds.
	- 11 cabinets can be opened/closed.
	- The cello & piano can temporarily play music.
	- The 2 central bunkers can be separately blown up by rocket launchers (only while inside them) or by other radiusdamage explosions (objects inside them will disappear).
	- Some lasers added to outline the map's edges and other invisible walls/edges.
- For "g_ubermods 1":
	- 2 auto-spotlights in the 2 wooden towers will follow loops of SplinePath nodes on the map, following any player that gets too close to the lights.
	- 2 spotlight color switches can turn on/off the rapid color-changing of the auto-spotlights or turn on/off slower color-changing.
	- 3 sets of bangalore wallbombs added.
	- 4 radiobomb walkies added.
	- All lasers added to outline the map's edges and other invisible walls/edges.
