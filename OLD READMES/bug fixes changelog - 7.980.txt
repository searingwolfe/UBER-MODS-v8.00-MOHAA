v7.980 (1-29-2025): - Players running OpenMOHAA will no longer get auto-kicked by cvars/adminstuff.scr's "check_player_stufftexts" thread, since OpenMOHAA players cannot have their names changed via "stufftext ("name " + local.name)".
- The "using_OpenMOHAA" thread checks if there is a "cl_guid" cvar present in their ".userinfo" string. This only serves as a temporary fix for OpenMOHAA players until a better one is made.

- Readjusted global/ambience_mp.scr, allowing ambience volumes with the same music file to overlap each other, making it much easier to script indoor volumes for complex building structures.

- Fixed Cyber Attack, Search & Destroy, Freeze Tag UBER gametypes that weren't removing "revivetrig" entities for frozen bodies when they disappear or get melted (entity count would slowly increase by 1 per frozen body).

- Players' viewangles in drivable vehicles/boats will now match the vehicle's/boat's angles, including when driving up/downhill and driving on sideways-sloped terrain.
- Fixed drivable vehicles' "shift_down" sound not matching the correct vehicle type (truck, halftrack, other) when decelerating.
- Destroyed vehicles will now loop fire sounds.

- Light Bombs will now kill players if they directly impact them (not including the players that launched them).
- Light Bombs can now disable vehicles/tanks if they directly impact them, causing them to get flooded (audible water drip sounds and smoke visible, headlights turn off). Flooded vehicles will reset after the vehicle/tank's "reset time".
- Slowed down Giant Bombs' explosion/travel time from 1.50 seconds to 2.15 seconds.

- Fixed global/player_spotlight.scr parameters, allowing auto spotlights to be mounted on more than just the floor (left wall, right wall, or ceiling).
- Spotlights can change players' illumination color even if they've already been spotted.

- The global/water_wade_sounds.scr script now makes players play a small water impact sound if they were < 125 units above the corresponding water volume, and a big water splash sound if > 125 units (if parameter "bigsplash" = 1).

- Drivable tanks that suddenly fly up to some maps' ceilings before exploding will now be auto-moved back to the ground, which already occurs in M4L0's "vehicles_undermap" thread (excluding M1L2A, M1L2B, M2L3, M4L1, M4L2).
- Fixed 20mm cannons' explosion radiusdamage height by adding +100 units to them, for all maps with 20mm cannons.
- Added all TDM spawn locations to the list of FFA spawns, for all fully modded singleplayer maps.
- Fixed "consoleprint" threads not having accurate entity counts, by accounting for sv_maxclients.
- Fixed some of M1L2A and other maps' basebuilder objects.
- Fixed some ambience volumes in M2l2B.
- Fixed global/player_spotlight.scr (auto-spotlights) not doing the "slowrainbow" effect when a map_triggers/spotlight_colorswitch.scr with "slowrainbow" parameter gets triggered.

- Added 2 more vehicles in M4L2 after removing more unused entities, but replaced them all with opeltrucks.
- Fixed M4L2 train crash script (when train is about to crash) by crashing/exploding early if a vehicle blocking its path won't explode.

- Added maps/gen_mapscripts/mapwall.scr for simplifying the spawning of invisible walls for buildings, barriers, rooftops, cliffs, etc.

- Removed more unused sounds from ubersound/ubersound.scr for all singleplayer maps.
- Replaced all custom player "pain" and "death" sounds from ubersound/uberdialog.scr with German AI pain/death sounds in singleplayer maps, to help prevent players disconnecting with "ERROR: MAX_GAMESTATE_CHARS exceeed".

---------------

- global/deathcam.scr: New mod added that auto-respawns dead players to spectate their killers, creating "kill cams" or "death cams". Only works for MOHAA Reborn 1.12.
- Add exec global/deathcam.scr to any map .scr, or in global/dmprecache.scr to run.
- While spectating your killer, press FIRE to fully respawn as normal.
- Type into the server's console "g_deathcams 0" to disable this mod, or "g_deathcams 1" to re-enable it.

- If "level.deathcam_respawn = 1", dead players will auto-respawn after "level.deathcam_respawn_time" seconds.
- level.deathcam_time_until_spectate = time delay in seconds until killed players begin spectating their killers (ideally set to "0" or "1.6").
- If level.deathcam_time_until_spectate < 1.6, dead bodies will disappear instead, and this variable will revert to "waitframe", or "0.05" seconds.
- If level.deathcam_time_until_spectate >= 1.6, players can respawn much sooner by pressing/holding FIRE.

---------------

- M4L3 fully modded. 4 vehicles, 1 flak88, 2 nebelwerfers, 8 extra throwing knives added to the map. Only drivable opeltrucks are included (speed increased to 400, only for this map).
- NOTE: adding too many different vehicles/tanks, or adding vehicles with non-truck sounds (original map included truck sounds) while other mods are enabled, will cause players' game to disconnect with "ERROR: MAX_GAMESTATE_CHARS exceeed".

- Airstrikes occur at random times, and along any X-Y-axis direction on the map.
- 13 bangalore wall-bombs (only the indoor ones are included by default, due to high total entity count): 6 indoor sets spread out within the 3 central buildings, 7 outdoor sets in each of the small red alarm huts.

- The large metal gate near the Allies-side tents can slide open/closed with a nearby pulsating electrical switch.
- The wooden gates near the Allies and Axis spawns can be opened/closed by pressing USE(e) near the center of them.
- 1 blue-laser ladder added to climb up/down the watchtower with the auto-spotlight.

- Players walking through the river will play water-moving sounds, small splashing sounds if falling from < 125 units above the water, or a large splashing sound if > 125 units (from global/water_wade_sounds.scr).

- 2 explosives (originally for blowing up tanks) can be blown up with grenades, similar to minen (entmint) bombs in obj/obj_team3 map.
- 3 sets of paper documents can be blown up with grenades.
- The cardgame table can be kicked over by blowing it up with grenades.
- 5 fireplaces in the central buildings have a valve switch for closing/opening the chimney valve, which causes black smoke to emit/stop emitting (respectively) out of the fireplace.
- 2 black 20mm flak cannons can be moved up/down or blown up.
- 3 radios can play music or static sounds.
- 2 toilets can be flushed, and 4 sink/tub faucets can be turned on/off to loop water dripping sounds.
- The static green opeltruck near the Allies tents can be turned on/off near the driver-side door, and the horn can be honked by holding USE(e) for 1 second while the truck is on.
- 19 cabinet switches can open/close cabinets (none are included by default, due to high total entity count).
