v7.955 (6-2-2024): - More improvements in adminstuff.scr to prevent "stufftext" hackers from joining or copying admins' names:
- Non-admin players will have name-priority over other players that copy their name if they held their name the earliest (in current level.time map time) and if they joined the server first.
- Ensured that "SAME NAME FIX" script waits for the player to finish running "check_player_stufftexts", and ensured that "check_player_stufftexts" thread doesn't prematurely end before the player fully connects to the server.

- Before a map switch or map restart, the script will delete and write a "cvars/playernames.txt" file containing all players' names and IPs in the current map.
- Players with the wrong IP address can still copy names in this list, but if a player finally loads in, or leaves and rejoins later in the same map whose name and IP match a name, that player will have name-priority over his own name.

- Passenger riders & turret users in drivable tanks, vehicles, and boats have further improved scripts to prevent them from getting stuck inside vehicles or other players when exiting them.
- Dogs will go into the 1st available passenger seat for drivable vehicles with a 30 Cal turret gun (jeep.tik, sdkfz.tik, sdkfz_afrika.tik), instead of saying "dogs cannot use vehicle turrets".

- Fixed rare bug that prevented turret players from dying if their vehicle driver runs over another vehicle and blows himself up.
- This bug also prevented turret players from ever dying again, until they switch teams or until "$player[turret player clientnum] takedamage" is executed.

- Dogs can now use and fly with jetpacks, visible on the dogs' backs.

- Giant Bomb and Light Bomb triggers are now visible on the dogs' right sides.
- Both of these triggers will explode much faster when launching near the ground below the player owner's feet.

- Flyable planes will now explode mid-air if they touch any Giant Bombs or Light Bombs launched by other players, with kills/scorepoints given to the player that launched them.
- Rare server crash fix for Giant/Light Bomb triggers by reworking scripts. Server would crash if shooting them directly at a flyable plane's propellers.
- Reworked scripts by replacing "waitmove" with a physics_on projectile and using "waittill touch".
- Slowed down Light Bomb velocity time from 0.35 to 0.80 seconds, since these new physics_on projectiles will stray away from their horizontal trajectory if their time-until-impact is faster than 0.80. 

- Fixed scorepoints not being given to players flying planes when they shoot and kill nebelwerfer users with the 30 Cal or MG42.
- Fixed NULL errors relating to a flyable plane's scale, and rarely occuring after planes crash into the ground.

- The 6 UBER triggers: giant bomb, light bomb, +200 health, toxic snowball ammo, grenade ammo, rocket launcher ammo, will always stay at their current "level.spot_[trigger]" origin, even if other scripts are moving the origin.

- Removed some unwanted door-closing sounds in maps/gen_mapscripts/doorsgates.scr. Reworked trigger sounds, added metal_doors_solid and metal_hatch threads.
- Added players' ability to extinguish their flames inside any "level.water_volumes" volume if they get caught on fire by a bonfire trigger, from maps/gen_mapscripts/bonfire.scr.

- Bomberplane airstrikes' and airstrike killstreaks' dropped bombs will make a water explosion if dropped on top of water, only if an level.water_volumes array exists.
- Before any bomberplane.scr or bomberplane_nospline.scr script runs, add a level.water_volumes array in the map script (example below) and add origin, setsize1, setsize2 (similar to triggers).
- Water volumes added to mohdm4, obj_team4, M2L2A, M2L2B, M2L2C, M3L1A, M3L1B.

	water_volumes: // these are for any airstrikes that drop bombs into the ocean.

		level.water_volumes = makeArray // from dm/mohdm4
			( 1407 799 32 ) ( -3039 -1654 -1000 ) ( 1920 0 10 ) // origin, setsize1, setsize2.
			( -1632 -855 32 ) ( -8000 0 -1000 ) ( 0 3355 10 )
			( -6050 2500 32 ) ( -8000 0 -1000 ) ( 0 8000 10 )
		endArray
	end

- Modders can now assign UBER gametypes for different maps in a single map rotation (in global/uberversion.scr), but this will disable the "g_ubergametype" cvar since they will be hard-coded in the list.

- Added rotation and boosted scale of $bombexplosive in global/cyberattack_searchdestroy.scr so they're easier to see and distinguish from the Radiobomb Walkies.
- Added "The bomb has been dropped!" messages when players drop bombs, but not when the dropped bomb causes the round to end.

- Fixed M1L1 vehicle tele for tanks to go through the town entrance.
- Fixed "minenbombs" threads in various maps (particularly obj_team3) so they stop blocking players' paths.
- Fixed bangalore array errors in M2L2C from 2 bangalores having the same name.
- Bangalores are now visible on dogs' left sides when picked up.
- Some global/spawnladder.scr ladders readjusted. If a solidclip was spawned for the ladder, the ladder's trigger should be 20+ units away from it, and extend 50 units above the upper-floor.

- Fixed rare case in cyberattack_searchdestroy.scr where players switching teams while dead wouldn't remove their frozen bodies, and thus causing the script's Allies/Axis teamcounts to become inaccurate.
- Fixed "cybsnd_debug 1" cvar not working anymore if left on while the server changes maps. Use this cvar to continuously print to console the Allies/Axis' alive & total teamcounts. If any of these are inaccurate, the script has broken and requires a map restart.
- Fixed a potential spamming NIL error in global/give_players_knives.scr.

---------------

- M3L1A fully modded. 5 flyable planes, 2 jetpacks, 2 flak88s, 2 nebelwerfers, 4 tanks, 2 boats added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, extra throwing knives not added.
- 1 bangalore wallbomb at the trench bunker entrance. Airstrikes occur at random times, and along any X-Y-axis direction on the map.

- Random artillery explosions occur in the beach craters, at 6 $higgins_runup_mortar1 [mortar6] locations, and once per time-cycle at any random map location.

- 6 original higgins boats will begin moving toward the beach after a random amount of initial map time.
- These boats' solid clips were readjusted to better fit players, who can jetpack or eject from planes to land in the boats.
- $higgins2 will always get destroyed and never respawn, but the other 5 $higgins1 [higgins6] boats can blow up from grenades, rockets, etc at any time and respawn after 60 seconds.
- Higgins boats that are destroyed will slowly sink down and run continuous fx_water_spray emitters while sinking.
- Once the higgins boats drop their doors upon landing, teleporters between the boats and the beach water are spawned, allowing players to hop on/off the boats.
- Some Giant Bomb trigger and Rocket Ammo trigger origins are glued to 5 of the higgins boats.

- 3 bangalores on the beach can be picked up and planted on the nearby barbwire to blow it up (other bangalores are removed after the barbwire is gone).
- An ocean blocker thread prevents the drivable higgins boats (near edges of map) from going onto dry land.

- Invisible map walls prevent players' projectiles from going through cliffs or through the ground.
- Thick green lasers outline the map's borders to reclaim missing land areas and prevent players from falling underneath them.
- Red lasers inside the beach bunkers outline the waist-level walls for players to see how much cover they have, when sniping other players down at the beach.
- One ladder spawned in the trench, and marked by a blue laser.

---------------

- M3L1B fully modded. 5 flyable planes, 3 flak88s, 2 nebelwerfers, 5 tanks, 4 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, extra throwing knives not added.
- 3 bangalore wallbombs on Axis' side upper hill at 3 bunker door exits. Airstrikes occur at random times, and along any X-Y-axis direction on the map.

- Random artillery explosions occur in the beach and hill craters, and once per time-cycle at any random map location.
- If any $mortar_dirt_nosound emitters (from plane/vehicle/tank, Giant Bomb/Light Bomb, or airstrike bomb explosions) impact a "bunker_roof_volumes" region above the ground, $bunker_dust1 emitters will sprinkle dust inside the bunker.

- The two AA Guns can be blown up by with large explosions (anything except for grenade explosions).
- 3 minenbombs (entmint mines) that explode if grenades/rockets/etc blow up near them.
- One minenbomb will not respawn (if 2 destructible crates are destroyed), but will instead knock over the nearby metal card table.
- 2 radios have triggers for playing radio music.

- The main beach bunker metal doors can now be opened/closed, with the upper-lower parts of entrance door opening/closing separately. A metal hatch can also be opened/closed.
- One ladder spawned in the trench (blue laser), and 2 ladders spawned inside the dark empty beach bunker (purple lasers).

- Invisible map walls prevent players' projectiles from going through cliffs or through the ground.
- NOTE: avoid flying too high above the map while in spectator, since this map is very large. Viewing too much of the map at one time will cause a game crash (runtime error).

---------------

v7.958 (6-11-2024): - Major script revisions for cyberattack_searchdestroy.scr to ensure that Allies/Axis' alive & total teamcounts remain accurate (mainly "players_perteam_status" thread).
- Bugs appeared when $player[1] left the game before $player[2], making $player[2] become $player[1] in the teamcounts arrays before the arrays had a chance to remove the now-NULL $player[2].
- Instead of filling the arrays with $player[local.i] in a for-loop, the arrays instead check for players' entnums (player entity numbers will not change if other players leave before them).
- Revised "player_fromspectator" and added a "player_mef_weaponclass" thread to simplify assigning a weaponclass to players, and improve accuracy when dead/frozen players are respawned with their old weaponclass.
