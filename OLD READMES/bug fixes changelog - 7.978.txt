v7.978 (11-14-2024): - UBER MODS is now compatible with MOHAA 1.11 (non-Reborn), Spearhead, and Breakthrough. However, some mods may still cause bugs in SH or BT.
- To use these mods in AA, SH, or BT, use the provided zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz_UBER_V7.978_AA-SH-BT.pk3.

- Increased initial vehicle's turnspeed acceleration when players begin driving and turning at the same time.

- Throwing knives can now kill drivers (not in sdkfz, sdkfz_afrika, shermantank), randomly kill a passenger or the driver if 1+ passengers are riding in the vehicle.

- New feature added in basebuilder: when placing down objects, the player can hold the FIRE button to hold still the nonsolid object, and let go of FIRE to place down the object.
- If holding FIRE for 3+ seconds while placing down an object, placement will be cancelled (laser will turn green). Press FIRE again to uncancel (place down now).

- Added team avatars for flyable planes, and ensured they always remain below the plane's hull so they don't obstruct the player's view.

- Added a "gates_slide" thread in maps/gen_mapscripts/doorsgates.scr for sliding opening/closing gates along a straight horizontal line.
- Parameters: targetname left gate, targetname right gate, move angle (move left gate towards this angle, right gate moves opposite direction), distance to move gates, time duration

- Fixed rare bug where tank loopsounds would keep playing endlessly for a player that exited a tank.
- Added "sqrt", "arcsine", "arccosine", and "arctangent" functions in global/math.scr to recreate some MOHAA Reborn functions for regular MOHAA.
- Removed some unnecessary teles in M2L2C.
- Fixed more ambience volumes in M2L2B and M2L2C.
