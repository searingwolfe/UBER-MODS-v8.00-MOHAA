<><><> Updates & Bug Fixes <><><>

v7.94 (2-24-2023): - Major script updates. 3 more singleplayer maps now fully modded.
- All drivable vehicles and boats can now drive in reverse much easier than before, simply by holding MOVE BACKWARD (S) key. This also works when holding FIRE to look behind.
- Players driving vehicls or boats can also hold MOVE LEFT (A) or MOVE RIGHT (D) to look left or right, only while not driving (controlled by global/playervehicle_movement.scr, which reads current VEHICLE states from nangle_aa_torso.st).

- Vehicle & boat passengers can now shoot while riding (hold Secondary FIRE to look around), and be shot/killed.

- Press JUMP to exit vehicles/boats/tanks in any driver seat, passenger seat, or vehicle turret seat (not using USE(e) anymore).

- The global/nangle_aa_torso.st & legs.st (bt and sh too) statefiles include updated VEHICLE states for looking left/right and reversing.
- VEHICLE_PASSENGER state (replaces STAND) & numerous _V state variants (copies of states from STAND) prevent camera jittering for passengers.
- In the 3 "legs.st" statefiles, the "unarmed_idle" animations are commented out to prevent "Warning: Can't find player animation 'unarmed_idle'" from printing to console when entering/exiting vehicles/tanks.

- For LADDER_UP/DOWN_LEFT/RIGHT states, the CAN_CLIMB_UP/DOWN_LADDER conditions are removed, allowing some Trigger_Use entities (i.e. in M2L2C) to serve as ladders when "local.player = parm.other; local.player forcetorsostate GET_ON_LADDER" is included in their setthreads.

- Improved passenger origin placements to keep players in their seats while vehicles of various speeds are moving.
- Fixed jeeps & sdkfz halftracks not allowing other passengers to hop in when a player is using the 30cal turret.

- Throwing knives, Giant Bombs, Light Bombs, and killstreaks can only be placed/thrown with USE(e) + Secondary FIRE (right-click, zoom).
- Doing USE(e) + Primary FIRE does not work anymore, but holding down both USE(e) + Primary FIRE + Secondary FIRE (holding left-click + right-click) does still work.

- Fixed tank shell projectiles not shooting straight for some angles. The projectile will now always shoot directly at the crosshairs' target, greatly improving accuracy.

- Bazooka & Panzerschreck rockets deal much more damage now, but only in a 100 unit radius (for destroying vehicles & flak88s easier). Panzerschreck rockets now shoot in straight lines (same as Bazooka). Projectile scale and light radii reduced too.

- New CVAR added: cvars/coord_pointer.scr. Type "coord_pointer [player number or player name]" into console to give/take a coord pointer.
- i.e. "coord_pointer 1". Giving $player[1] a coord_pointer. The "origin + angle" are also saved to a "cvars/coords.txt" file.
- The laser pointer for iprints & console-prints "origin + angle" of the pointed target, in integer form. Double-click in the same exact spot to print "origin + angle" in 3 decimal places.
- NOTE: You may need to be noclipping or in spectator for double-clicking to work, since player is alive and always breathing.

- Flyable planes' rockets will now always move faster than their plane's speed. Rocket speed = 2000 * plane speed; plane speed = sqrt(velocity[0]^2 + velocity[1]^2 + velocity[2]^2).
- Flyable planes' bullets & rockets no longer deal damage to teammates or deal radiusdamage if they explode near a teammate (unless in FFA or g_teamdamage = 1).
- Flyable planes cannot shoot their MG42 or 30 Cal with Secondary FIRE (right-click, zoom) anymore, since Secondary FIRE already makes them drop bombs.
- Potentially fixed the rare bug when a player flying a plane blows up, but instead of dying, the player survives and is invisible for a few seconds.

- Added date & time console-printing after loading a new map, and after a player connects/disconnects (for qconsole.log'ing purposes). Current time prints in 24:00:00-hour format.

- Server auto-reopen scripts added to the UBER MODS's .zip file for both Windows & Linux (README for these files included in the Server Auto-Reopen Scripts folder). 

---------------

- New global/victory_podium.scr script spawns 3 crates for creating a 1st, 2nd, 3rd place podium for those with the highest kills in the game.
- The podium spawns dummy player models for the 3 winners, based on highest kills, on their respective podium spots (1st on top of 2 crates, 2nd on one crate, 3rd on the floor).
- If 2+ winners have the same kills, the player with the lowest deaths will be deemed the actual winner.
- If 2+ winners still have the same kills and deaths, then the player who joined first (the lowest clientnum) will be deemed the actual winner.

- This script also spawns an intermission camera, and launches fireworks when all players are teleported to the camera near the end of the map (based on "timeduration" parameter).
- If "timeduration" is set as 0 or NIL, then fireworks will not launch, since all while-loops end when the map's intermission actually begins (when scoreboard is visible, fading to black, changing maps).

- If camera origin & camera angles are set to "auto", then the script will automatically set the camera's origin & angles roughly 550 units away from "angle" parameter facing forward, with camera's angle +180 degrees from "angle" and looking 17 degrees upward.

Parameters: origin, angle for podium players, camera origin (or "auto"), camera angles (or "auto"), time duration of fireworks (5 = 00:05 seconds of map time remaining to end game; 0 or NIL = no fireworks), ...
... distance until exploding (default = 300), particle time (default = 2.5), explosion scale (default = 0.8).

Example: exec global/victory_podium.scr ( 220 -41 48 ) -90 auto auto 5

- For testing where the podium will be, run "exec global/victory_podium.scr::test ( 220 -41 48 ) -90" and change origin + angle to spawn 3 visible solid crates.
- For testing only the fireworks, run "exec global/victory_podium.scr::fireworks ( 220 -41 48 ) -90" and change origin + angle to continuously launch fireworks (to check distance, particle time, explosion scale, etc).

exec global/victory_podium.scr::test ( 220 -41 48 ) -90		// testing purposes only; spawn and show the podium crates.
exec global/victory_podium.scr::fireworks ( 220 -41 48 ) -90	// testing purposes only; launch fireworks continuously.

- NOTE: If setcvar "timelimit" "0" or "", then the podium winners threads will never run, since the map will never end.
- An optional thread ends the game immediately for "timeduration" seconds while launching fireworks, then ends the map.
- NOTE: the "main" thread must run first too! ("exec global/victory_podium.scr ( -700 -1200 -3 ) -90 auto auto 5") must have executed already, otherwise the intermission camera will be missing.

Parameters: origin, angle for podium players, time duration until map ends (0 to end now), distance until exploding, particle time, explosion scale.
Example: exec global/victory_podium.scr::map_ended ( -700 -1200 -3 ) -90 7

Before the ::map_ended line, an optional "level.VP_winnertype = allies" or "axis" can be included to only show podium winners from that team (i.e. for a custom OBJ gametype).

---------------

- New global/spawnladder.scr script spawns an invisible ladder trigger_multiple. Players must be looking directly at ladder, and must be looking up/down more than 30 degrees to climb these ladders.
- Ideally, player's hands should not go behind the ladder when climbing (use 3rd person to check your hands). Ignore this for curved ladder steps (i.e. on uboats).
- Adjust the "offset" parameter if desired, or if player is getting stuck on stuff while climbing the ladder.

Parameters: origin, angle for players to attach, ladder setsize1, ladder setsize2, optional offset distance away from ladder (lower = players hands closer to ladder, higher = further away, default = 14). If > 18, players cannot climb the ladder.

Example: exec global/spawnladder.scr ( -200 300 0 ) 90 ( -1 -10 0 ) ( 1 10 250 )
Example2: local.ladder = thread global/spawnladder.scr::main ( -200 300 0 ) 90 ( -1 -10 0 ) ( 1 10 250 ) 10

---------------

- New global/vehicle_tele.scr script allows vehicles to travel through walls/gates to a normally inaccessable area.
- Lasers can be spawned into a local.lasers array via the "spawnlaser" thread in this script (paramters: origin, endpoint, initial color, scale).

- The optional teleporting alignment parameter forces vehicles to move along the 0-180 degree axis or 90-270 degree axis, preventing them from falling out of the map when teleporting across long distances.
- A solid floor entity is required for teleporters across long distances through map walls, to keep the teleporting vehicles from blowing up or falling endlessly into the void.

Parameters: origin, setsize 1, setsize 2, laser array (or NIL if no lasers), teleporting alignment (NIL = none, 0 = 0-180 axis, 1 = 90-270 axis), vehicle height after teleporting (default/NIL = 0), ...
... teleporting speed (default/NIL = 25, max = 300), spawn solid floor (0 or NIL = no, 1 = yes).

Example: exec global/vehicle_tele.scr ( 4193 -1119 -511 ) ( -222 -680 -10 ) ( 222 680 355 ) local.lasers 1 0 50 1

	local.lasers[1] = thread global/vehicle_tele.scr::spawnlaser ( -1507 -6227 -511 ) ( -1507 -6227 -262 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3 // origin, endpoint, initial color, scale
	local.lasers[2] = thread global/vehicle_tele.scr::spawnlaser ( -1507 -6224 -259 ) ( -1507 -6464 -259 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3
	local.lasers[3] = thread global/vehicle_tele.scr::spawnlaser ( -1507 -6461 -262 ) ( -1507 -6461 -511 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3
	exec global/vehicle_tele.scr ( -1502 -6344 -511 ) ( -30 -115 -10 ) ( 30 115 200 ) local.lasers 0

---------------

- M2L2A fully modded. 3 flyable planes, 4 higgins boats, 4 uboats, 3 jetpacks, 2 flak88s, 1 nebelwerfer, 1 tank and 3 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 8 extra throwing knives also added.
- 6 bangalore wallbombs mostly in Allies spawn; 2 of these alarm switches keep a nearby red light on until the switches have reset. Airstrikes are not included in this level, since half of the level is inside.

- Drivable uboats added into global/playerboat.scr. Similar to drivable higgins boats, the uboats have 5 extra passenger seats that allow passengers to stand on the uboat's upper platforms.
- Uboat drivers can press Primary FIRE to shoot a large tank shell projectile in a horizontal line, or press Secondary FIRE to throw grenades in front of the uboat. These projectiles will not hurt teammates.

Uboat Parameters: targetname (must not exist yet), model path, origin, angles, health, vehicle speed, reset time, boat scale.
Uboat Example: exec global/playerboat.scr boat2 vehicles/uboat.tik ( -913 3598 -400 ) ( 0 -90 0 ) 250 40 45 1.0

- A vehicle tele (thick red lasers) allows vehicles to travel through the metal doors that separate the Allies spawn and uboat area, instead of using the single door near the ocean.
- NOTE: The walls on maps M2L2A, M2L2B, M2L2C are glitchier than normal for vehicles. Driving at an angle into walls will get vehicles stuck inside them (if player exits the vehicle inside a wall, they will auto-respawn after 3 seconds).

- The naxos prototype in the scientists' room can be blown up with grenades.
- The crane's loopsound is louder. A spotlight is mounted on the outer wall of the crane's metal basket, with nearby tele to enter/exit this basket.
- The airtanks in the bottom-floor Alies spawn can be turned on/off. Sound entities added to 6 air vents.

- Red and green lasers added to the rooftops near the ocean, indicating solid walls (green) and roof-edges that players can jump off from (red).

---------------

- M2L2B fully modded. 4 flyable planes, 4 higgins boats, 4 uboats, 4 jetpacks, 1 flak88, 1 nebelwerfer, 1 tank and 3 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 8 extra throwing knives also added.
- 4 bangalore wallbombs, 2 inside the uboat sub, and 2 between other uboat docks. 1 set of bangalore wallbombs triggered via detonator on top of the uboat sub. Airstrikes are not included in this level.

- A vehicle tele allows vehicles to travel through a metal gate to a normally inaccessable uboat dock.

- Numerous sound entities added inside the uboat sub: air vents, generators, transformers, water dripping near the toilet. Press USE(e) near the toilet to flush it. Sound entities added to 3 air vents outside the sub.
- Two radios in the uboat sub can also play music by pressing USE(e) a few times.

- Red and green lasers added to the rooftops near the ocean, indicating solid walls (green) and roof-edges that players can jump off from (red).

---------------

- M2l2C fully modded. 4 flyable planes, 5 higgins boats, 4 uboats, 5 jetpacks, 2 flak88s, 2 nebelwerfers, 1 tank and 6 vehicles added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 8 extra throwing knives also added.
- 3 bangalore wallbombs, 2 in Axis spawn, 1 in Allies spawn. 2 sets of bangalore wallbombs triggered via detonator on top of both uboat subs. Airstrikes are not included in this level.

- A vehicle tele allows vehicles to travel through a metal gate to a normally inaccessable uboat dock.
- Another vehicle tele allows travel between the large white platform in the ocean and the roomy garage behind the Axis spawn. Vehicles can travel through the adjacent metal fence without teleporting.
- These are the best, most portable versions of vehicle teles. Parameters allow for any array size of lasers, teleporting alignment along X or Y axis, and teleporting speed

Parameters: origin, setsize 1, setsize 2, laser array, teleporting alignment (NIL = none, 0 = 0-180 axis, 1 = 90-270 axis), vehicle height after teleporting (default/NIL = 0), teleporting speed (default/NIL = 25).

Example: thread vehicle_tele ( 4193 -1119 -511 ) ( -222 -680 -10 ) ( 222 680 355 ) local.lasers 1 0 50

	local.lasers[1] = thread spawnlaser ( -1507 -6227 -511 ) ( -1507 -6227 -262 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3 // origin, endpoint, initial color, scale
	local.lasers[2] = thread spawnlaser ( -1507 -6224 -259 ) ( -1507 -6464 -259 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3
	local.lasers[3] = thread spawnlaser ( -1507 -6461 -262 ) ( -1507 -6461 -511 ) ( 1 0 0 ) 3
	thread vehicle_tele ( -1502 -6344 -511 ) ( -30 -115 -10 ) ( 30 115 200 ) local.lasers 0

- 4 ladders added to the 2 docked uboats for players to climb up/down them. Players must be looking directly at ladder, and must be looking up/down more than 30 degrees to climb these ladders.
- Adjust the "offset" parameter if desired, or if player is getting stuck on stuff while climbing the ladder.

Parameters: origin, angle for players to attach, ladder setsize1, ladder setsize2, optional offset distance away from ladder (lower = players hands closer to ladder, higher = further away, default = 14). If > 18, players cannot climb the ladder.

Example: exec global/spawnladder.scr ( -200 300 0 ) 90 ( -1 -10 0 ) ( 1 10 250 )
Example2: local.ladder = thread global/spawnladder.scr::main ( -200 300 0 ) 90 ( -1 -10 0 ) ( 1 10 250 ) 10

- Sound entities added to 12 air vents throughout the uboat docks. Tranformer and red HVAC sounds added in Axis spawn. 3 more air vent sounds added in the vents above the Axis spawn.
- Red and green lasers added to the rooftops near the ocean, indicating solid walls (green) and roof-edges that players can jump off from (red).
