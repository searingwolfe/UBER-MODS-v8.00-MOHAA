v7.979 (12-31-2024): - Added "g_uberhardcode 1" CVAR to force set all maps' "g_ubergametype" CVARs to the list found in global/uberversion.scr, and disable the "g_ubergametype" CVAR.
- Set "g_uberhardcode 0" to re-enable the "g_ubergametype" CVAR for changing UBER gametypes (0 = regular TDM/FFA as set by "g_gametype", cyb, snd, ft, bb).

- Cleaned up alienx/basebuilder.scr script. Bugs fixed, such as teleporters not counting towards object limit. MG42s & Flak88s now add 2 to the object limit, since they also spawn a bipod.
- Players can now switch between lifts, teleporters, objects by touching a new build trigger when holding any of them (before, you would get stuck with a lift/tele until placing them).

- global/respawn_stuck_fix.scr script will end prematurely if the player enters a drivable tank/vehicle/airplane/guided missile or gets a jetpack.
- Added water impact sounds for throwing knives.
- Medics in OBJ maps will look at players when healing them. Medic dialogue sounds also fixed (saying, "here you go, lieutenant!").

- Velocity/speed for Giant Bomb, Light Bomb, and Guided Missile projectiles will max out around at around 7500, to keep them from flying off-course from the player's crosshairs.

- Guided Missile script revamped and bugs fixed (GuidedMissile/trigger.scr): Flying speed increased to 700 (level variables at top of script to easily mod this script).
- Missiles (and player's angles) launch vertically from the ground, resembling cruise missiles.
- When the player presses FIRE, the missile shoots horizontally down player's crosshairs trajectory, rapidly increasing in velocity.
- Improved flying and explosion sounds. Missile kills count as scorepoints, and don't damage teammates or the vehicles they're in. Explosions deal radiusdamage to also destroy map objects.
- Missile health bar appears when flying them, and it switches between jetpack fuel and missile health when flying/not flying a guided missile (instead of disappearing the health bar).

---------------

- M4L2 fully modded. 2 vehicles, 3 flak88s, 2 nebelwerfers, 8 extra throwing knives added to the map.

- A train travels across the train tracks from the Allies-side spawn towards the Axis-side spawn.
- Any player or vehicle that gets in front of the train will die/explode.
- Up to 2 players can ride inside the train by pressing USE(e) near the train's cabin, and exit by holding USE(e) to tele on top of the train.
- Once the train enters the Axis-side train tunnel, players that exit will instead be respawned.
- Inside the train tunnel, the train moves away from the map for 0.5x the "level.train_off_time" (default = 60 seconds), before returning towards the map for the other 0.5x.

- There are 3 different tracks that the train can follow: into the train tunnel (default track), fully stopping, or blowing up.
- A train switch near the middle of the map switches the tracks to the path where the train comes to a full stop and parks.
- A train switch in the Axis house overlooking 2 train tracks switches to the path where the train blows up.
- These train switches cannot be triggered while the train is moving across the map (not blown up, not stopped, not in the tunnel).

- While stopping or blowing up, sparks from the train's brakes appear underneath it.
- If the train comes to a complete stop, players riding inside them will tele next to the train.
- If the train blows up, loud explosions and train crashing sounds occur before the train flips over onto its side.
- The "level.train_off_time" variable also controls how long to reset the train if it is parked or blown up.

- 2 pairs of metal gates can slide open/closed by pressing USE(e) near the middle of each pair. This also allows vehicles to travel through them.
- If metal gates on the train tracks are closed or are currently opening/closing, the train will smash through them, making them swing quickly away.
- The smashed metal gates will respawn when the train respawns at the beginning of the tracks.
- If the gates were open or sliding open, they will respawn opened. If the gates were closed or sliding closed, they will respawn closed.

- The elevator and its gate moves faster. Teles are placed above/below the elevator for players to escape in case they get stuck in the elevator shaft.

- 2 bangalore wall-bombs: 1 in the small bunker near the left train tracks (the path where the train comes to a full stop), and 1 at the double-doors near the left train tracks.
- 3 radios can be turned on/off to play music or static sounds.
- 12 transformer humming sounds, 1 water spigot sound, 1 air vent sound added.
