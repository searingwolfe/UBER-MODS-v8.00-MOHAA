v7.977 (10-25-2024): - Improved driving physics for vehicles/boats:
- Acceleration and deceleration added, allowing vehicles to roll a few feet after stopping, or slowing to a full stop before reversing (from driving forward) or driving forward (from reversing).
- Vehicles/boats will now reverse at half its maximum speed. Turning speed will also increase/decrease with acceleration/deceleration.

- Players can now reload nebelwerfers without waiting for "Rockets: 0" by right-clicking (or weapon-zoom button).
- Nebelwerfers will now display "Rockets: Reloading" on the screen when currently reloading rockets (must fully reload before it can shoot again).

- alienx/basebuilder.scr script improved and new building features added: Hold right-click to change build-laser from green to blue; this activates "Trimming Mode" for the object being held.
- In trimming mode, players can lean left/right to slowly adjust roll-angles (x,y,z angles = pitch,yaw,roll).
- In trimming mode, players can crouch to rotate the object's yaw-angle by 90 degrees, flipping the lean left/right angles to adjust pitch-angles (but still looks like adjusting roll-angles from player's point of view).
- In trimming mode, players can walk (not run) forward/backward to increase/decrease their build-laser's distance between them and their object being held.
- When a new object is picked up, their build-laser's distance is automatically reset back to "level.basebuild_laserdist" (default = 350).

- In base-builder, placing down MG42s or mini-flak88 (flame-throwing MG42s) will now spawn an MG42 bipod beneath them.
- The build-laser now briefly flashes red when placing an object.

- global/legs_movement.scr: New script for indicating whether players are running or walking forward/backward/left/right.
- This script runs from entry commands in the 8 respective mike_legs.st running/walking states, and are saved as "local.player.legs_state_runforward = 1", "local.player.legs_state_walkbackward = 1", etc.

- Revamped global/respawn_stuck_fix.scr: All players who recently spawned will have 2 timers counting before any respawns occur (runs from global/dmprecache.scr).
- If players are alive and stuck in a wall for 3+ seconds ("falling", but unable to move), they will auto-respawn.
- If they do move within 3 seconds and are not "falling", respawn_stuck_fix.scr will turn off for that player until they've respawned after dying, switching teams, or spawning after the map changes.

- global/doorlocked.scr: New simple script for adding simulated $door_locked triggers, but without spawning any entities.
- Parameters: trigger origin (standing on ground in front of a door), door type (wood, metal, gateiron, gatelarge, gatemetal, garagedoor), extra sounds (0 = no, 1 = yes for "wood", "metal", "gatelarge" only).
- Example: exec global/doorlocked.scr ( 234 -2453 129 ) wood
- Example: exec global/doorlocked.scr ( 234 -2453 129 ) gatelarge 1

- Players will now respawn after building ends in base-builder, when they're driving/riding in tanks/vehicles/planes/boats/flak88s/nebelwerfers.
- Fixed some telecrouch.scr triggers in M1L3C.
- Added fire loopsounds at 2 fireplaces in M3L2.
- Added a level.water_volume to M1L3C.
- Added a ladder to M2l2B and M2L2C for the wide green ladder (behind fences in sub area).
- Fixed some undermap.scr triggers in M1l2B.
- Fixed some ambience volumes in M1L2A, M2L2A, M2L2B, and M2L2C.
- Moved some player spawns in M4L0 to prevent players being spawned inside walls.
- Fixed some bugs and missing code lines in global/playerboat.scr for higgins boats.
- Simplified water volumes in M2L2A, M2L2B, M2L2C so other scripts properly respond to them.
- Fixed Giant Bomb explosion sounds that are also audible at origin = ( 0 0 0 ), when they should only be audible at the destination target.

- Sounds added for opening/closing cabinet switches (cabinetswitch.scr).
- Sounds added for throwing knives when they impact the ground/wall or when they hit and kill players.

---------------

- M4L1 fully modded. 10 vehicles, 4 tanks, 3 flak88s, 3 nebelwerfers, 8 extra throwing knives added to the map.

- The altar can slide open/closed by pressing the USE(e) key near the pulsating red button on the altar.

- Airstrikes occur at random times, and along any X-Y-axis direction on the map.
- 3 bangalore wall-bombs: 2 in the middle building, 1 under the altar inside the church.
- 1 set of bangalore wall-bombs at the church entrance (bangalores binded to altar), and 1 set of detonator wall-bombs inside the church basement near the radio (blow up the basement).

- The 2 fireplace in the middle building has a valve on the left side for closing/opening the chimney valve, which causes black smoke to emit/stop emitting (respectively) out of the fireplace.
- The radio in the church basement can play music or static sounds. 1 cabinet in the middle building can be opened/closed.
- The toilet can be flushed and sink faucet can be turned on/off to loop water dripping sounds.

- Solid walls added at the edges of various roads and cliffs to prevent drivable vehicles from going inside walls.
- Some walls can still be driven through, but all areas that players can exit vehicles to walk around/shoot from behind walls are blocked off.
- Solid ground added in 3 areas for players to walk on: behind green hedges and the cliff near the destroyed plane, cliff side near the middle skinny road, behind sandbags near church.
