<><><> Updates & Bug Fixes <><><>

v7.90 (11-14-2023): - Reworked the turretplayer_reset threads for drivable tanks/vehicles. Almost all bugs for turret slots fixed (players should not get frozen anymore).
- Players now properly detach from turrets, turrets fully reset and relock, and players respawn if necessary for the following [driver / turret player] cases:
died / died; alive / died; gotout / alive; spectator / alive; newteam / alive; left / alive; alive / gotout; alive / spectator; alive / newteam; alive / left

- Fixed NULL errors for flyable planes dropping bombs after the plane is already destroyed. 
- Fixed numerous console errors printing when a player attempting to fly for the 1st time (1st flight instructions printing) leaves the game before a flyable plane spawns.

- Fixed sdkfz.tik vehicles' VehicleTurretGun slot so it stops bouncing around when driving (removed some "lean" .tik anims).
- Removed the "bombsoff" parameter from the new global/bomberplane.scr airstrikes script; "bombsoff" = 1 if the parameter "bombs" = 0 or NIL.
- Fixed more missing sound aliases in cyberattack_searchdestroy.scr for "the bomb has been placed!" Allies/Axis dialogue, for singleplayer maps only.

---------------

- M1L3B fully modded. 4 tanks, 8 drivable vehicles, and 4 flyable plane triggers added to the map. 2 sets of radiobomb-walkies, 4 extra throwing knives also added.
- 1 Flak88 on the Axis side, and 1 Nebelwerfer on the Allies side. 2 sets of bangalore wallbombs: 1 above the Axis red-light bunker, and two above the Allies two-door building.

- Airstrikes every 2 minutes, 50% chance Allies or Axis strike. For Allies strikes: 50% chance the planes will spawn from left or right side of the airstrip, and 33% chance for c47s flying. 

- All parked planes are destructible. The black 20mm Flak cannon's angles can be moved from 0, 30, 60 degrees by pressing USE near it, or blow it up with 2+ grenades.
- Teles allow players to walk along the entire Axis-side cliff, or on the Allies-side cliff near the back airstrip-side corner.

- Player spawns added and distributed more widely across the Allies/Axis spawns.
- Invisible walls block prevent any players or projectiles from going under the map or going behind rock cliffs and shooting through them.
- Some teles allow players to stand on rock cliffs or platforms on top of large rocks, to shoot players from high above them.
- Alarm switches in the dead-end halls behind the openable doors each blow up a bangalore outside the door.
- Cyber Attack and Search & Destroy bombs and bombsites added to the map. Base-Builder Allies/Axis labels fixed in the map script.
