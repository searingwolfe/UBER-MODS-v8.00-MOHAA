// Use camera to freeze a player's view, then check the viewangles[] changes to initial value to move a mouse around. 
// The total area of the mouse is the largest area used by the menu HUD. When a user clicks/double-clicks/right-clicks,
// the event of the menu element lying directly underneath the cursor is triggered with the event argument.
// -> also provide support for left, right, up, down & tab navigation.
// -> load custom config file

/* Components:
- Menu
- Page
- Tab (same as page, but a tab; tabbar needs to be present if there are more than 1 tab, it needs to be given a location within the menu and will auto-scale and resize its components to fit the menu)
- Label
- Button
- List (scrollable would be nice)
- Selectable List (click to de-/select; also scrollable)
- Input (Text input field!)
- PopUp (widget, separate 'limited' menu, needs a higher indexes than all other elements -> need for fixed element size)
- ProgressBar 
- Checkboxes
- RadioButton
- PictureBox (with caption)
- ModelDisplay (using globalwidget! User passes on which one to use)
AND NO MORE
