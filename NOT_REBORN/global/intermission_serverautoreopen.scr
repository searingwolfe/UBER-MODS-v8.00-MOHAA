// This script serves as a standalone file for any "registerev intermission" threads from other mods (currently: cvars/adminstuff.scr & global/victory_podium.scr).
//
// Using MOHAA_server_auto-reopen_Windows.bat script (available only from xNULL website download for UBER MODS),
// this script can also indicate whether the server crashed and closed, or crashed and is hanging with a Runtime error.
// Runtime errors almost always occur when the server is changing maps (currently running "intermission", but not necessarily caused by it).
// If the server crashes, errors will appear in this standalone script, printing at minimum: "(global/intermission_serverautoreopen.scr," to qconsole.log just before hanging or closing.

main: // This mod only works for Reborn 1.12 or Nightfall (see "_Reborn.pk3" version of UBER MODS).
